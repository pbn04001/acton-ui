// Build the state object in stages by progressively adding state attributes in each stage.
// Later stages can use prior stage's state.

// Params: Similar to combineReducers a simple object with each key
// being a state namespace and each value being a reducer function.

// Example:
// const reducer = pipelineReducers({ a: aReducer, b: bReducer, c: cReducer })
//
// reducer is now a reducer function where:
//   1. aReducer will run with 3 parameters, it's prior state, the action, and the
//      'nextState' object which is an empty object.
//   2. The result of aReducer will be added to the 'nextState' object
//   2. bReducer will then run with the same 3 params but now 'nextState' has the 'a' attribute.
//   2. cReducer will then run with the same 3 params but now 'nextState' has the 'a' & 'b' attributes.
//   3. The final result will be an object of shape { a, b, c }
